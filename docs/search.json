    "text": "1.1 Motivation\nYellow taxis are a crucial component of the transportation system in New York City (NYC). The decision to delve into the analysis of NYC Yellow Taxi Trip data for 2014 is driven by the desire to highlight patterns and trends on different time scales that may offer valuable insights into the various characteristics of the NYC yellow taxi system.\nIn 2014, the total number of trips is approximately uniform across the 12 months. Therefore, we chose to focus on November 2014, a month with exciting holidays and events in NYC. November 2014 featured several notable holidays and events:\n\nNYC Marathon (November 2, 2014)\nVeterans Day (November 11, 2014)\nNYC Documentary Film Festival (November 13-20, 2014)\nThanksgiving Day Parade (November 27, 2014)\n\nThis study serves as a gateway to understanding the complexity of the NYC transportation system, particularly in November 2014. Through this exploration, we aim to compare and contrast the dynamics of yellow taxi usage, fare distribution, and tipping behaviors on holidays and event days with those on regular days."

    "section": "1.3 Contexts",
    "text": "1.3 Contexts\nIn NYC, Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) licenses over 130,000 vehicles and ensures these vehicles undergo thorough safety and emissions inspections. These vehicles must be driven by TLC-licensed drivers who have passed background checks and fulfilled education requirements mandated by the TLC. There are 4 different types of TLC-licensed vehicles: Yellow Taxi, Green Taxi, For-Hire Vehicles, and Commuter Van and Paratransit. This study is only focused on Yellow Taxi identified by the yellow color, taxi “T” markings, and medallion license numbers on the roof and sides of the vehicle.\nHere are some more information about the Yellow Taxi (link to reference):\n\nYellow Taxi is the only vehicle licensed to pick up street-hailing passengers anywhere in NYC.\nYellow Taxi charges standard metered fares for all street hail trips.\nYellow Taxi smartphone apps can offer set, upfront pricing for trips booked through an app.\n\nHere are some more information about the Yellow Taxi fare system (link to reference):\n\nInitial Charge: The meter starts with a base fare when you enter the taxi. This initial charge is a fixed amount ($2.50 in 2014).\nDistance Charge: As the taxi travels, there is a per-mile charge. The meter calculates this based on the distance covered during the trip ($2.50 per mile in 2014).\nWaiting Time: If the taxi is is traveling under 12 miles per hour or is in slow-moving traffic, there may be a waiting time charge ($0.50 per minute in 2014).\nSurcharge: Depending on the time and location, there might be surcharges. For example, there may be additional charges during peak hours or for trips to or from certain areas.\nTolls and Fees: Passengers are generally responsible for paying any tolls incurred during the trip. In addition to tolls, there may be additional fees for certain circumstances.\nTips: While tips are not part of the official fare, it’s customary to tip taxi drivers in the United States. Passengers usually tip a percentage of the fare, typically around 15% to 20%.\n\nIn November 2014, there were several holidays and events in New York City:\n\nNYC Marathon (November 2, 2014): The New York City Marathon is one of the world’s largest marathons, with around 50,000 participants running through all five boroughs of the city. The event attracts runners from around the globe and is a major highlight for both participants and spectators.\nVeterans Day (November 11, 2014): Veterans Day is a federal holiday honoring military veterans. In NYC, there are often parades and events to commemorate and thank veterans for their service.\nNYC Documentary Film Festival (November 13-20, 2014): This film festival showcases a wide range of documentary films at various locations in the city. It’s an excellent opportunity for film enthusiasts to explore thought-provoking and informative documentaries.\nThanksgiving Day Parade (November 27, 2014): The Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade is a famous annual event that takes place on Thanksgiving Day. The parade features giant balloons, floats, marching bands, and performances, attracting large crowds along the parade route."

    "title": "2  Data",
    "section": "2.1 Technical Description",
    "text": "2.1 Technical Description\nThe original dataset, which describes all yellow taxi trips completed in 2014 in NYC, was downloaded on the NYC OpenData website (link to dataset). The data was collected and provided to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) by technology providers authorized under the Taxicab Passenger Enhancement Program (TPEP). Thus, the trip data was not created by the TLC, and as explained on the agency website (TLC website), the TLC company cannot confirm the accuracy or completeness of these data. As a result, the data may differ from the total number of trips dispatched by all TLC-licensed bases in 2014.\nThe data was created on 06/03/2015, the data was last updated on 02/10/2016, and the metadata was last updated on 05/09/2022. The data is valuable for historical purposes, so its update frequency is set to Historical Data. The downloaded dataset is a .csv file containing 165 million rows and 19 columns. Each row corresponds to a yellow taxi trip completed in 2014 in NYC and is described by 19 attributes, including the vendor type, the pickup/dropoff time and geographic coordinates, the number of passengers, the trip distance, the fare amount, the tip amount, and others.\nGiven the substantial size of the dataset and our initial motivations, we chose to select a reduced sample of the data. From the NYC OpenData website, we only exported the taxi trips of November 2014, as we are interested in how special events like Thanksgiving and the NYC Marathon impact the trends. Moreover, the payment_type attribute that indicates how the passenger paid for the trip has six different levels: (1) Credit card, (2) cash, (3) no charge, (4) dispute, (5) unknown, and (6) voided trip. The data reveals that the first and second categories (credit card and cash) represent 92% of all taxi trips. Therefore, we chose to focus our analysis on observations with the payment type of credit card and cash. The resulting dataset has around 12 million observations."

    "text": "2.3 Research Plan\nThe 19 attributes contained in the dataset with new variables will help us answer the research questions from the introduction. New variables include:\n\ntrip duration in minutes (using pickup datatime and dropoff datetime columns)\nmonth, weekdays, hour of the day (using pickup datatime column)\nperiod of the day (using pickup datetime column)\nfare amount per mile in dollars/mile (using fare amount and trip distance columns)\n\nWe have at our disposal all the taxi trips in 2014 as well as the pickup times in datetime format. Using lubridate package, we are able to retrieve the month, day of the month, weekday, and hour of the pickup/dropoff datetimes. Those new columns are helpful to visualize the trends throughout different time scales. In particular, we may visualize the trend in the number of trips by day in November and identify whether weekends, holidays, or special events like the NYC Marathon may impact the number of trips.\nGiven the geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude) of pickup and dropoff locations, we are able to map the taxi trips. In particular, we may visualize the most and least busy pickup/dropoff locations on a NYC map. The datetime will also allow us to visualize how holidays and special events may impact the pickup/dropoff location distribution in the city. It would be interesting to visualize the business working hours by mapping the number of pickups/dropoffs between different periods of the day for a given location like the Financial District or World Trade Center Area.\nUsing the fare_amount attribute, we can visualize the overall trends of the taxi fares across the different periods of the day and days of the week. Comparing the results for holidays and the results for usual days, we can determine whether the fares increase or decrease. It would be interesting to combine this attribute with the trip distance or the trip duration to identify whether there is a correlation between these variables.\nSimilarly, with the tip_amount column, we can study the tipping trend across different periods of the day and different days of the week. We can check if special events in the month affect the tipping behavior of passengers. Finally, we can compare the average tips for different pickup/dropoff locations using the longitude and latitude variables."
