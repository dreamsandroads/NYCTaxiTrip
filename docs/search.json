    "text": "1.1 Motivation\nYellow taxis are a crucial component of the transportation system in New York City (NYC). The decision to delve into the analysis of NYC Yellow Taxi Trip data for 2014 is driven by the desire to highlight patterns and trends on different time scales that may offer valuable insights into the various characteristics of the NYC yellow taxi system.\nIn 2014, the total number of trips is approximately uniform across the 12 months. Therefore, we chose to focus on November 2014, a month with exciting holidays and events in NYC. November 2014 featured several notable holidays and events:\n\nNYC Marathon (November 2, 2014)\nVeterans Day (November 11, 2014)\nNYC Documentary Film Festival (November 13-20, 2014)\nThanksgiving Day Parade (November 27, 2014)\n\nThis study serves as a gateway to understanding the complexity of the NYC transportation system, particularly in November 2014. Through this exploration, we aim to compare and contrast the dynamics of yellow taxi usage, fare distribution, and tipping behaviors on holidays and event days with those on regular days."

    "section": "1.3 Contexts",
    "text": "1.3 Contexts\nIn NYC, Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) licenses over 130,000 vehicles and ensures these vehicles undergo thorough safety and emissions inspections. These vehicles must be driven by TLC-licensed drivers who have passed background checks and fulfilled education requirements mandated by the TLC. There are 4 different types of TLC-licensed vehicles: Yellow Taxi, Green Taxi, For-Hire Vehicles, and Commuter Van and Paratransit. This study is only focused on Yellow Taxi identified by the yellow color, taxi “T” markings, and medallion license numbers on the roof and sides of the vehicle.\nHere are some more information about the Yellow Taxi (link to reference):\n\nYellow Taxi is the only vehicle licensed to pick up street-hailing passengers anywhere in NYC.\nYellow Taxi charges standard metered fares for all street hail trips.\nYellow Taxi smartphone apps can offer set, upfront pricing for trips booked through an app.\n\nHere are some more information about the Yellow Taxi fare system (link to reference):\n\nInitial Charge: The meter starts with a base fare when you enter the taxi. This initial charge is a fixed amount ($2.50 in 2014).\nDistance Charge: As the taxi travels, there is a per-mile charge. The meter calculates this based on the distance covered during the trip ($2.50 per mile in 2014).\nWaiting Time: If the taxi is is traveling under 12 miles per hour or is in slow-moving traffic, there may be a waiting time charge ($0.50 per minute in 2014).\nSurcharge: Depending on the time and location, there might be surcharges. For example, there may be additional charges during peak hours or for trips to or from certain areas.\nTolls and Fees: Passengers are generally responsible for paying any tolls incurred during the trip. In addition to tolls, there may be additional fees for certain circumstances.\nTips: While tips are not part of the official fare, it’s customary to tip taxi drivers in the United States. Passengers usually tip a percentage of the fare, typically around 15% to 20%.\n\nIn November 2014, there were several holidays and events in New York City:\n\nNYC Marathon (November 2, 2014): The New York City Marathon is one of the world’s largest marathons, with around 50,000 participants running through all five boroughs of the city. The event attracts runners from around the globe and is a major highlight for both participants and spectators.\nVeterans Day (November 11, 2014): Veterans Day is a federal holiday honoring military veterans. In NYC, there are often parades and events to commemorate and thank veterans for their service.\nNYC Documentary Film Festival (November 13-20, 2014): This film festival showcases a wide range of documentary films at various locations in the city. It’s an excellent opportunity for film enthusiasts to explore thought-provoking and informative documentaries.\nThanksgiving Day Parade (November 27, 2014): The Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade is a famous annual event that takes place on Thanksgiving Day. The parade features giant balloons, floats, marching bands, and performances, attracting large crowds along the parade route."

    "section": "2.1 Technical Description",
    "text": "2.1 Technical Description\nThe original dataset, which describes all yellow taxi trips completed in 2014 in NYC, was downloaded on the NYC OpenData website (link to dataset). The data was collected and provided to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) by technology providers authorized under the Taxicab Passenger Enhancement Program (TPEP). Thus, the trip data was not created by the TLC, and as explained on the agency website (TLC website), the TLC company cannot confirm the accuracy or completeness of these data. As a result, the data may differ from the total number of trips dispatched by all TLC-licensed bases in 2014.\nThe data was created on 06/03/2015, the data was last updated on 02/10/2016, and the metadata was last updated on 05/09/2022. The data is valuable for historical purposes, so its update frequency is set to Historical Data. The downloaded dataset is a .csv file containing 165 million rows and 19 columns. Each row corresponds to a yellow taxi trip completed in 2014 in NYC and is described by 19 attributes, including the vendor type, the pickup/dropoff time and geographic coordinates, the number of passengers, the trip distance, the fare amount, the tip amount, and others.\nGiven the substantial size of the dataset and our initial motivations, we chose to select a reduced sample of the data. From the NYC OpenData website, we only exported the taxi trips of November 2014, as we are interested in how special events like Thanksgiving and the NYC Marathon impact the trends. Moreover, the payment_type attribute that indicates how the passenger paid for the trip has six different levels: (1) Credit card, (2) cash, (3) no charge, (4) dispute, (5) unknown, and (6) voided trip. The data reveals that the first and second categories (credit card and cash) represent 92% of all taxi trips. Therefore, we chose to focus our analysis on observations with the payment type of credit card and cash. The resulting dataset has around 12 million observations."

    "text": "2.3 Research Plan\nThe 19 attributes contained in the dataset with new variables will help us answer the research questions from the introduction. New variables include:\n\ntrip duration in minutes (using pickup datatime and dropoff datetime columns)\nmonth, weekdays, hour of the day (using pickup datatime column)\nperiod of the day (using pickup datetime column)\nfare amount per mile in dollars/mile (using fare amount and trip distance columns)\n\nWe have at our disposal all the taxi trips in 2014 as well as the pickup times in datetime format. Using lubridate package, we are able to retrieve the month, day of the month, weekday, and hour of the pickup/dropoff datetimes. Those new columns are helpful to visualize the trends throughout different time scales. In particular, we may visualize the trend in the number of trips by day in November and identify whether weekends, holidays, or special events like the NYC Marathon may impact the number of trips.\nGiven the geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude) of pickup and dropoff locations, we are able to map the taxi trips. In particular, we may visualize the most and least busy pickup/dropoff locations on a NYC map. The datetime will also allow us to visualize how holidays and special events may impact the pickup/dropoff location distribution in the city. It would be interesting to visualize the business working hours by mapping the number of pickups/dropoffs between different periods of the day for a given location like the Financial District or World Trade Center Area.\nUsing the fare_amount attribute, we can visualize the overall trends of the taxi fares across the different periods of the day and days of the week. Comparing the results for holidays and the results for usual days, we can determine whether the fares increase or decrease. It would be interesting to combine this attribute with the trip distance or the trip duration to identify whether there is a correlation between these variables.\nSimilarly, with the tip_amount column, we can study the tipping trend across different periods of the day and different days of the week. We can check if special events in the month affect the tipping behavior of passengers. Finally, we can compare the average tips for different pickup/dropoff locations using the longitude and latitude variables."

More precisely, there are around 500k trips (80k more than the overall median) every Saturday of November. The plot also shows that the number of taxi trips increase gradually from Monday to Saturday, except for the week of Thanksgiving.\nWe also observe a peak on the 1st of November:\n\n\nCode\nggplot(taxi, aes(x = hour, fill=weekend_color)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(title = \"Hourly Number of NYC Taxi Trips on Days in November\",\n       x = \"Hour\", y = \"Count\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Weekday\" = \"grey\", \"Weekend\" = \"lightblue\"), \n                    name = \"Type of Day\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 23, 1)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(l) {trans = l / 1000; paste0(trans, \"K\")}) +\n  geom_rect(data = subset(taxi, day %in% c(1)), \n            fill = NA, colour = \"red\",\n            xmin = -Inf, xmax = Inf, ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf) +\n  facet_wrap(. ~ day) +\n  theme(legend.position=\"top\",\n        axis.text.x = element_text(size=6, angle=0),\n        plot.title = element_text(size=20),\n        legend.title = element_text(size = 18),\n        legend.text = element_text(size = 18))\n\n\n\n\n\nOne explanation could be that more people took taxis after Halloween events (Halloween: October 31st). The trend of hourly taxi rides on November 1st is not distinct compared to other days. However, the numbers of taxi rides per hour are higher than on any other day. Unfortunately, we do not have enough information to explain the higher demand of taxi rides on November 1st compared to other days.\nWe also investigate the average hourly number of trips for weekdays and weekends (weekdays vs. weekends).\n\n\nCode\nhourly_sum &lt;- taxi %&gt;%\n  group_by(weekend_color, hour) %&gt;%\n  summarise(sum_count = sum(n()))\n\n# Calculate the number of weekdays and weekends\ndaily_counts &lt;- taxi %&gt;%\n  group_by(weekend_color) %&gt;%\n  summarise(daily_count = n_distinct(day))\n\nhourly_sum &lt;- merge(hourly_sum, daily_counts, by = \"weekend_color\")\n\n# Calculate the standardized average\nhourly_sum &lt;- hourly_sum %&gt;%\n  mutate(standardized_avg = sum_count / daily_count)\n\n\n# Plotting the data\nggplot(hourly_sum, aes(x = hour, y = standardized_avg)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', aes(fill = weekend_color)) +\n  labs(title = \"Average Hourly Number of NYC Taxi Trips (Weekdays vs. Weekends)\",\n       x = \"Hour\", y = \"Count\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 23, 1)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(l) {trans = l / 1000; paste0(trans, \"K\")}) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Weekday\" = \"grey\", \"Weekend\" = \"lightblue\"), \n                    name = \"Type of Day\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\",\n        axis.text.x = element_text(size=6, angle=0)) +\n  facet_grid(. ~ weekend_color)\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, the number of rides is significantly higher during midnight and early morning hours on weekends than on weekdays. This is probably because people return from parties and night events more frequently on weekends than on weekdays. Other than this, the trend seems quite similar. For weekdays, the busiest hours are from 6 pm to 8 pm, which is logical as this is the time frame when people return from their offices. Evenings are generally busier than any other time of the day.\n\n\n3.1.2 What are the most and least busy locations during weekends/holidays compared to other days?\n\n3.1.2.1 Overview\n\n\nCode\nset.seed(123)  \nsample_size &lt;- 10000 \n\n# Subsampling on a regular Sunday\nreg_sunday &lt;- taxi[taxi$day == 9 & taxi$hour &gt;= 9 & taxi$hour &lt;= 13]\nsubsampled_data &lt;- reg_sunday[sample(nrow(reg_sunday), sample_size), ]\n\n\nHere is an interactive map showing the NYC Yellow Taxi Pickup and Dropoff Locations:\n\n\nCode\nleaflet(subsampled_data) %&gt;% \n    addTiles() %&gt;%\n    setView(-73.9, 40.75, zoom = 11) %&gt;% \n    addCircles(~pickup_longitude, ~pickup_latitude, weight = 1, radius=10, \n                 color=\"red\", stroke = FALSE, fillOpacity = 0.7) %&gt;%\n    addCircles(~dropoff_longitude, ~dropoff_latitude, weight = 1, radius=10, \n                 color=\"blue\", stroke = FALSE, fillOpacity = 0.7) %&gt;% \n    addLegend(\"bottomright\", colors= c(\"blue\", \"\", \"red\"), labels=c(\"Dropoff Locations\", \"\", \"Pickup Locations\")) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of the data points concentrate in Manhattan, indicating high taxi activity within the borough. In particular, Midtown and Lower Manhattan appear as central hubs with a significant concentration of pickups and dropoffs. Upon closer inspection of the map, we notice that Times Square, Grand Central, and Penn Stations stand out as major contributors to the high density of taxi pickups and dropoffs. Beyond Manhattan, airports such as JFK, Newark, and LaGuardia exhibit substantial taxi traffic.\nThese results highlight the significance of train stations and airports as major transportation hubs, with many passengers utilizing taxi services for departures and arrivals.\n\n\n3.1.2.2 Focusing on NYC Marathon (November 2nd, 9 AM to 1 PM)\n\n\nCode\n# Sub-sampling on marathon day\nmarathon &lt;- taxi[taxi$day == 2 & taxi$hour &gt;= 9 & taxi$hour &lt;= 13]\nsubsampled_marathon &lt;- marathon[sample(nrow(marathon), sample_size), ]\n\n\n\n\nCode\nregister_google(key = \"AIzaSyDaXmGKnccck8fdJe6lOUzGlrqMBl-InZ0\")\n\nnyc &lt;- c(lon = -73.971321, lat = 40.776676)\nnyc_map &lt;- get_map(location = nyc, zoom = 12)\n\np &lt;- ggmap(nyc_map)\n\nregular_sunday &lt;- p +\n  geom_point(data = subsampled_data, aes(x = pickup_longitude, y = pickup_latitude, color = 'Pickup'), size = 0.4) +\n  geom_point(data = subsampled_data, aes(x = dropoff_longitude, y = dropoff_latitude, color = 'Dropoff'), size = 0.4) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c('Pickup' = \"red\", \"Dropoff\" = \"blue\"), name = \"Location\") +\n  labs(title = \"Rides on Regular Sundays\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\",\n        title = element_text(size = 8))\n\nmarathon &lt;- p +\n  geom_point(data = subsampled_marathon, aes(x = pickup_longitude, y = pickup_latitude, color = \"Pickup\"), size = 0.4) + \n  geom_point(data = subsampled_marathon, aes(x = dropoff_longitude, y = dropoff_latitude, color = \"Dropoff\"), size = 0.4) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Pickup\" = \"red\", \"Dropoff\" = \"blue\"), name = \"Location\") +\n  labs(title = \"Rides on the Marathon Day (November 2nd)\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\",\n        title = element_text(size = 8))\n\ncombined_map &lt;- cowplot::plot_grid(regular_sunday, marathon, ncol = 2)\n\ncombined_map\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot on the left illustrates taxi pickups and dropoffs for a typical Sunday between 9 am and 1 pm, while the plot on the right displays data points for Marathon day (2nd of November) within the same time frame. We can clearly estimate part of the race route. There are notably fewer data points along both First Avenue and the northern section of Fifth Avenue around Central Park. Indeed, the marathon route goes all the way up to the Bronx along 135th Avenue via First Avenue and then down to the southern part of Central Park via Fifth Avenue, which explains the reduced number of data points in these specific areas.\n\n\n3.1.2.3 Focusing on Thanksgiving Parade\n\n\nCode\nbef_tgv &lt;- taxi[taxi$day == 26 & taxi$hour &gt;= 8 & taxi$hour &lt;= 12]\nsubsampled_bef_tgv &lt;- bef_tgv[sample(nrow(bef_tgv), sample_size), ]\n\non_tgv &lt;- taxi[taxi$day == 27 & taxi$hour &gt;= 8 & taxi$hour &lt;= 12]\nsubsampled_on_tgv &lt;- on_tgv[sample(nrow(on_tgv), sample_size), ]\n\naft_tgv &lt;- taxi[taxi$day == 28 & taxi$hour &gt;= 8 & taxi$hour &lt;= 12]\nsubsampled_aft_tgv &lt;- aft_tgv[sample(nrow(aft_tgv), sample_size), ]\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Penn Station:\n# nyc &lt;- c(lon = -73.993584, lat = 40.750580)\n# JFK airport:\n# nyc &lt;- c(lon = -73.780968, lat = 40.641766)\n\n# Grand Central:\nnyc &lt;- c(lon = -73.977295, lat = 40.752655)\n\nnyc_map &lt;- get_map(location = nyc, zoom = 13)\n\np &lt;- ggmap(nyc_map)\n\nplot_bef_tgv &lt;- p +\n  geom_point(data = subsampled_bef_tgv, aes(x = pickup_longitude, y = pickup_latitude, color = 'Pickup'), size = 0.4) +\n  geom_point(data = subsampled_bef_tgv, aes(x = dropoff_longitude, y = dropoff_latitude, color = 'Dropoff'), size = 0.4) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c('Pickup' = \"red\", \"Dropoff\" = \"blue\"), name = \"Location\") +\n  labs(title = \"Rides Before Thanksgiving (26th)\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\",\n        plot.title = element_text(size=12))\n\nplot_on_tgv &lt;- p +\n  geom_point(data = subsampled_on_tgv, aes(x = pickup_longitude, y = pickup_latitude, color = \"Pickup\"), size = 0.4) + \n  geom_point(data = subsampled_on_tgv, aes(x = dropoff_longitude, y = dropoff_latitude, color = \"Dropoff\"), size = 0.4) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Pickup\" = \"red\", \"Dropoff\" = \"blue\"), name = \"Location\") +\n  labs(title = \"Rides on Thanksgiving Day (27th)\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\",\n        plot.title = element_text(size=12))\n\ncombined_map1 &lt;- cowplot::plot_grid(plot_bef_tgv, plot_on_tgv, ncol = 2)\n\ncombined_map1\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot on the left illustrates taxi pickups and dropoffs for the day before Thanksgiving (26th, November) between 8 am and 12 pm, while the plot on the right displays data points for Thanksgiving day (27th, November) within the same time frame. Similarly, there are noticeably fewer data points around Sixth Avenue from 59th Street to 35th Street, where the Thanksgiving parade ends (also Macy’s location).\nWe would like to see if there is any difference in taxi trips before and after Thanksgiving, particularly near the Grand Central Station.\n\n\nCode\nnyc &lt;- c(lon = -73.977295, lat = 40.752655)\n\nnyc_map &lt;- get_map(location = nyc, zoom = 15)\n\np &lt;- ggmap(nyc_map)\n\nplot_bef_tgv &lt;- p +\n  geom_point(data = subsampled_bef_tgv, aes(x = pickup_longitude, y = pickup_latitude, color = 'Pickup'), size = 0.4) +\n  geom_point(data = subsampled_bef_tgv, aes(x = dropoff_longitude, y = dropoff_latitude, color = 'Dropoff'), size = 0.4) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c('Pickup' = \"red\", \"Dropoff\" = \"blue\"), name = \"Location\") +\n  labs(title = \"Rides Before Thanksgiving (26th)\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\",\n        plot.title = element_text(size=12))\n\nplot_aft_tgv &lt;- p +\n  geom_point(data = subsampled_aft_tgv, aes(x = pickup_longitude, y = pickup_latitude, color = \"Pickup\"), size = 0.4) + \n  geom_point(data = subsampled_aft_tgv, aes(x = dropoff_longitude, y = dropoff_latitude, color = \"Dropoff\"), size = 0.4) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Pickup\" = \"red\", \"Dropoff\" = \"blue\"), name = \"Location\") +\n  labs(title = \"Rides After Thanksgiving Day (28th)\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\",\n        plot.title = element_text(size=12))\n\ncombined_map2 &lt;- cowplot::plot_grid(plot_bef_tgv, plot_aft_tgv, ncol = 2)\n\ncombined_map2\n\n\n\n\n\nWe conclude that there is not much of a difference in trips near the Grand Central between the day before and after Thanksgiving."

As shown in the graph, most fare amounts fall between 0 and 50 dollars (there is a peak around 50 dollars).\nHence, we decide to take a closer look at fare amounts up to 100 dollars.\n\n\nCode\n# only 1726 trips are higher than 100 dollars so we can cut off those values\n# nrow(taxi[taxi$fare_amount &gt; 100])\n\ntaxi |&gt; filter(taxi$fare_amount &lt;= 100) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x=fare_amount)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,100, by=5)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(l) {trans = l / 1000000; paste0(trans, \"M\")}) +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of NYC Taxi Fare Amounts (~ $100)\", x = \"Fare Amount ($)\", y = \"Count\") \n\n\n\n\n\nWe observe that the majority of fare amounts are small values, typically from 2.5 to 10 dollars, reflecting the prevalence of short-distance trips. Additionally, there is a small peak at 50 dollars.\n\n\nCode\n# Mean fare amount per hour and payment type\ntaxi %&gt;%\n  group_by(weekend_color, hour, payment_type) %&gt;%\n  summarize(mean.fare = mean(fare_amount)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = mean.fare, color = payment_type, group = payment_type)) +\n  geom_point(stat = 'identity' ) +\n  geom_line(stat = 'identity', linetype = 'dotted') +\n  scale_color_discrete(labels=c('Credit Card', 'Cash')) +\n  facet_grid(. ~ weekend_color) +\n  labs(title = \"Average Fare Amount per Hour by Payment Type\",\n       x = \"Hour\", y = \"Average Fare Amount\", color = \"Payment\")\n\n\n\n\n\nWe would like to determine whether different payment methods have an impact on the hourly trend of fare amounts during weekdays and weekends. This plot compares the mean fare amount on weekdays and weekends in November for two payment types (credit card and cash). It’s important to note that there are around 50% more trips paid with credit card than with cash. On the plot, we observe a similar trend of mean fares across the hours for both payment types. However, the mean fare consistently remains higher for rides paid with credit cards than for rides paid with cash. There is a peak at 5 am, which is logical given the early morning hour. Hence, the trend of average fare amounts is similar across different payment methods on weekdays and weekends.\n\n\n3.2.2 Is there a relationship between fare amounts and the time of the day, the trip distance, or the trip duration?\nFare amount vs. Time of the Day\n\n\nCode\nggplot(taxi, aes(x = fare_amount)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  facet_wrap(. ~ fct_relevel(hour_category, \"early morning\", \"morning\", \"noon\", \"afternoon\", \"evening\", \"midnight\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of NYC Taxi Fare Amounts by Time of Day\",\n       x = \"Fare Amount ($)\",\n       y = \"Density\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\")\n\n\n\n\n\nWe notice that the distributions of fare amounts appear to be similar across different times of the day. In the morning and evening, there are more fares between 10 and 50 dollars compared to any other time of the day. This is probably because morning and evening are the rush hours (going to office / coming back from office) and the fare is less likely to be extreme.\nFare Amount vs. Trip Distance\n\n\nCode\ntaxi |&gt; \n  sample_frac(0.1) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x=fare_amount, y=trip_distance)) + \n  geom_point(alpha = 0.3, stroke = 0) + \n  labs(title = 'Scatter Plot of Fare Amount vs. Trip Distance',\n       x = \"Fare Amount ($)\",\n       y = \"Trip Distance (mile)\")\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems that there is a linear relationship between fare amount and trip distance, indicating that as the fare amount increases, the trip distance also increases, and vice versa. However, there are some outliers where the fare amount is high despite a small trip distance. Moreover, it seems like there are rounding patterns around 50-dollar-rides.\nFare amount vs. Trip Duration\n\n\nCode\nset.seed(123)\ntaxi |&gt; \n  sample_frac(0.1) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x=fare_amount, y=trip_duration)) + \n  geom_point(alpha = 0.3, stroke = 0) + \n  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(l) {trans = floor(l / 60); paste0(trans, \"\")}) +\n  labs(title = 'Scatter Plot of Fare Amount vs. Trip Duration',\n       x = \"Fare Amount ($)\",\n       y = \"Trip Duration (hr)\")\n\n\n\n\n\nMost trips are completed within 1.5 hour (90 minutes) with a fare range of 0 to 100 dollars. However, there are outliers, such as (1) an instance where the fare amount is relatively low (ex. around 5 dollars), but the trip duration is substantially high (ex. exceeds 14 hours), and (2) cases where the fare amount is significantly high, but the trip duration is notably short."

Passengers appear to tip more during the morning (between 7 am and 9 am) and the evening (after 8 pm) on weekdays (morning and evening are rush hours), as opposed to weekends. Conversely, passengers tend to tip less between 3 am and 5 am (even though we’ve previously observed that fare amounts are, on average, the highest at 5 am). Moreover, people generally tip less overall on weekends compared to weekdays. The highest tip percentages are observed during peak hours on weekdays.\n\n\n3.3.2 Do passengers tip more during holidays/weekend?\n\nWeekdays vs. Weekends\n\n\n\nCode\n# Mean tip amount per hour between weekdays and weekends\ntaxi %&gt;%\n  group_by(weekend_color, hour) %&gt;%\n  summarize(mean.tip = mean(tip_amount)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = mean.tip)) +\n  geom_point(stat = 'identity', aes(color = factor(weekend_color)), size = 3) +\n  geom_line(stat = 'identity', aes(color = factor(weekend_color)), linetype = 'dotted', size = 1) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"grey\", \"lightblue\")) + \n  facet_grid(. ~ weekend_color) +\n  labs(title = \"Average Tip Amount per Hour\",\n       x = \"Hour\", y = \"Average Tip Amount ($)\") +\n  guides(color=guide_legend(title=\"Type of Day\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nThe average tipping amount appears to be lower overall on weekends.

However, we can observe that from the evening on Thanksgiving day (27th) to the following day (28th), the average tip amount is very low.\nIn the green-highlighted graph displaying the hourly tipping trend on November 1st, the pattern is notably distinct from other days. People barely tip for their rides on November 1st, despite it being the date with the highest number of taxi rides (as discussed earlier, refer to the plot Number of NYC Taxi Rides per Day in November). One possible explanation is that people may have been too tired from celebrating Halloween.\n\n\n3.3.3 Do pick-up and drop-off locations impact the amount of tips?\nHere is an interactive map showing the distribution of NYC Yellow Taxi tip percentages:\n\n\nCode\n# Add jitter to tip_percentage\ntaxi$tip_percentage_jittered &lt;- taxi$tip_percentage + runif(length(taxi$tip_percentage), -0.01, 0.01)\n\n# Use the jittered tip_percentage for coloring\nmap &lt;- leaflet(data = taxi %&gt;% sample_frac(0.002)) |&gt; \n  addTiles() |&gt;  \n  setView(-73.9, 40.75, zoom = 11) |&gt; \n  addCircles(\n    ~pickup_longitude, ~pickup_latitude, \n    weight = 1, radius = 10, \n    color = ~colorQuantile(\"YlOrRd\", na.omit(taxi$tip_percentage_jittered))(tip_percentage_jittered),\n    fillOpacity = 0.8\n  ) |&gt; \n  addLegend(\n    position = \"bottomright\",\n    pal = colorQuantile(\"YlOrRd\", na.omit(taxi$tip_percentage_jittered)),\n    values = ~tip_percentage_jittered,\n    opacity = 0.8,\n    title = \"Tip Percentage\")\n\nmap\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no clear pattern of tipping behaviors. Some specific areas, such as LaGuardia airport, tend to concentrate higher tip percentages (between 50% and 100%). However, given our dataset limitations, we cannot confirm or refute the hypothesis that pickup/dropoff locations have an impact on the tipping behaviors. This graph could be improved by segmenting the map into zones. To do that, we can add a new column indicating which zone the point belongs to, using another dataset. We are then able to compute the mean tip percentage over the geographical zone and better visualize the areas with higher or lower tip percentages."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Through this project, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the trends in NYC Yellow Taxi Trips during November 2014, exploring various variables and time frames. We were particularly interested in examining the impact of weekends and holidays on the number of trips, the fare amounts and the tipping behaviors.\nWeekends and holidays have an evident impact on the number of trips. The same weekly trend in the number of rides repeats over the entire month; Saturdays consistently stand out with the highest number of rides in their respective weeks. Weekends contribute to a higher volume of taxi trips during early hours compared to weekdays, reflecting increased social activities. Thanksgiving also has a significant effect on the number of rides, leading to a noticeable dip in rides during the holiday. Maps allowed us to explore the central hubs of taxi pickups/dropoffs (mainly train stations and airports) as well as the influence of Marathon and Thanksgiving’s parade on taxi pickup and dropoff locations, revealing the routes associated with these events.\nWeekends have a meager impact on the average fares. The fare amount trends are similar between weekdays and weekends. Additionally, fare amounts are positively correlated to trip distances and trip duration, aligning with our expectations.\nDistinct tipping behaviors emerged during weekends and holidays compared to weekdays. People tend to tip less on average on weekends and holidays than on regular weekdays. The highest tipping percentages occur during rush hours on weekdays (mornings and evenings). While some specific areas, such as LaGuardia airport, may have a slight influence on tipping trends, with higher tip percentages, our dataset limitations prevented us from drawing definitive conclusions about the impact of pickup/dropoff locations on tipping behaviors.\nTo conclude, these findings allowed us to either validate or refute some of our initial assumptions about NYC Taxi Trip trends.\nLimitation. It is important to note that certain visualizations, such as scatter plots and maps, were created by subsampling the original dataset. This approach was employed to improve clarity and enhance the efficiency of graphical representation. Additionally, our analysis focused on data from the year 2014, which was chosen based on our requirements and data availability. However, this time frame may not be the most optimal for gaining a thorough understanding of the current taxi trends. Furthermore, more interesting studies could have been conducted with other datasets. In particular, integrating datasets specifying geographic zones could yield more comprehensive insights into tipping behaviors, improving the visualization of our maps. Incorporating weather forecasts or job employment data could also help us better understand the factors influencing taxi dynamics."
