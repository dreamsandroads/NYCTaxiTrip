# Introduction


## Motivation
Yellow taxis are a crucial component of the transportation system in New York City (NYC). The decision to delve into the analysis of **NYC Yellow Taxi Trip** data for 2014 is driven by the desire to highlight patterns and trends on different time scales that may offer valuable insights into the various characteristics of the NYC yellow taxi system.

In 2014, the total number of trips is approximately uniform across the 12 months. Therefore, we chose to focus on **November 2014**, a month with exciting holidays and events in NYC. November 2014 featured several notable holidays and events:

* Thanksgiving Day Parade (November 27, 2014)

This study serves as a gateway to understanding the complexity of the NYC transportation system, particularly in November 2014. Through this exploration, we aim to compare and contrast the dynamics of yellow taxi usage, fare distribution, and tipping behaviors on holidays and event days with those on regular days.

## Contexts
In NYC, Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) licenses over 130,000 vehicles and ensures these vehicles undergo thorough safety and emissions inspections. These vehicles must be driven by TLC-licensed drivers who have passed background checks and fulfilled education requirements mandated by the TLC. There are 4 different types of TLC-licensed vehicles: **Yellow Taxi**, **Green Taxi**, **For-Hire Vehicles**, and **Commuter Van and Paratransit**. This study is only focused on Yellow Taxi identified by the yellow color, taxi "T" markings, and medallion license numbers on the roof and sides of the vehicle.
