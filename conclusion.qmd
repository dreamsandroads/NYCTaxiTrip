# Conclusion

Through this project, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the trends in NYC Yellow Taxi Trips during November 2014, exploring various variables and time frames. We were particularly interested in examining the impact of weekends and holidays on the number of trips, the fare amounts and the tipping behaviors. 

Weekends and holidays have an evident impact on the number of trips. The same weekly trend in the number of rides repeats over the entire month; Saturdays consistently stand out with the highest number of rides in their respective weeks. Weekends contribute to a higher volume of taxi trips during early hours compared to weekdays, reflecting increased social activities. Thanksgiving also has a significant effect on the number of rides, leading to a noticeable dip in rides during the holiday. Maps allowed us to explore the central hubs of taxi pickups/dropoffs (mainly train stations and airports) as well as the influence of Marathon and Thanksgiving's parade on taxi pickup and dropoff locations, revealing the routes associated with these events.

Weekends have a meager impact on the average fares. The fare amount trends are similar between weekdays and weekends. Additionally, fare amounts are positively correlated to trip distances and trip duration, aligning with our expectations.

Distinct tipping behaviors emerged during weekends and holidays compared to weekdays. People tend to tip less on average on weekends and holidays than on regular weekdays. The highest tipping percentages occur during rush hours on weekdays (mornings and evenings). While some specific areas, such as LaGuardia airport, may have a slight influence on tipping trends, with higher tip percentages, our dataset limitations prevented us from drawing definitive conclusions about the impact of pickup/dropoff locations on tipping behaviors.

To conclude, these findings allowed us to either validate or refute some of our initial assumptions about NYC Taxi Trip trends. 

**Limitation.** It is important to note that certain visualizations, such as scatter plots and maps, were created by subsampling the original dataset. This approach was employed to improve clarity and enhance the efficiency of graphical representation. Additionally, our analysis focused on data from the year 2014, which was chosen based on our requirements and data availability. However, this time frame may not be the most optimal for gaining a thorough understanding of the current taxi trends. Furthermore, more interesting studies could have been conducted with other datasets. In particular, integrating datasets specifying geographic zones could yield more comprehensive insights into tipping behaviors, improving the visualization of our maps. Incorporating weather forecasts or job employment data could also help us better understand the factors influencing taxi dynamics.
